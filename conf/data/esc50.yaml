# The Fourier transform is a mathematical technique used to decompose a signal into its constituent frequency components.
# It is widely used in audio signal processing to analyze, filter and manipulate sound signals.
#
# The Fourier transform of a time-domain signal, such as an audio signal,
# produces a frequency-domain representation of the signal.
# This representation shows the relative amplitudes of the different frequency components that make up the signal.
# This information is useful for understanding the characteristics of the sound, such as its pitch and timbre,
# and for filtering or modifying specific frequency ranges.
#
# There are different types of Fourier transforms, the most common is the discrete Fourier transform (DFT),
# which is used to convert a discrete-time signal into a discrete-frequency representation.
# The DFT requires a large amount of computation, so in practice,
# the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm is often used to efficiently calculate the DFT.
#
# The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is a variation of the DFT that is used to analyze audio signals.
# It breaks the audio signal into short segments and applies the DFT to each segment,
# providing a time-frequency representation of the signal.
# This is useful for analyzing the frequency content of a sound over time,
# and for tasks such as pitch detection and audio compression.

# Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)
# The result of these steps is a set of coefficients that represent the spectral envelope of the audio signal.
# The number of MFCCs used in a given application can vary, but typically, between 12 and 40 coefficients are used.
#
# MFCCs are robust to variations in the audio signal, such as changes in pitch, speed, and noise.
# They are widely used in speech and music processing tasks such as speech recognition, music genre classification, and speaker identification.
# They can also be used in conjunction with other features, such as Chroma feature or Spectral rolloff, to improve the performance of audio classification tasks.
